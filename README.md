# Conjunctiva-automatic-segmentation
An algorithm written in Python for the automatic segmentation of the conjunctiva using kmeans and ncut:
- Insert the directory path of your conjunctiva images in PATH_ITALIAN
- Insert the destination directory path in PATH_KMEANS where your kmeans segmentations will be generated
